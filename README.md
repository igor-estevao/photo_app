# My Comments

-This Section of the Course, the professor used Rails 5 with old approaches to deal with StripeAPI.

I tried to adapt it to my vision of how to deal with it on Rails 7 with Turbo and TurboStreams.

## The basics are:

User has-1 Customer
Customer has-N Plans
Plan has-1 Price

I did not finished the migrations nor the Email configurations, but it is fully functional and you can edit it.

Any tips or sugestions, feel free to message me or fork the project :)

## Testing

For Testing, you must generate a MasterKey for credentials, then generate the development.yml.enc with theses commands

```
rails secret
```

Then the development credentials

```
EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit -e development
```

That you must update it with:

```yml
secret_key_base: <the key generated by the first command>

mailer:
  app_username: <your app username>
  app_password: <your app password>

stripe:
  stripe_test_publishable_key: <your test primary key>
  stripe_test_secret_key: <your test secret key>
```
